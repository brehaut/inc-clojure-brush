# (inc clojure-brush)

## ;; Work In Progress

This project aims to product a smarter clojure brush for [Syntax Highlighter](https://github.com/alexgorbatchev/SyntaxHighlighter) that goes further than existing efforts such as [sh-clojure](https://github.com/sattvik/sh-clojure). This brush attempts to be moderately aware of sexp forms in clojure and provide sensible highlighting rules for core forms, and hopefully guess sensibly for additional forms. 

The current state of this project is a stream of consciousness javascript file. You'll need to know how to set up SyntaxHighlighter if you want to play with it (i'll get a demo setup later).

**Not Ready For Real Use!** 

No error handling exists yet. Bugs abound.

The code is pretty hairy in a lot of places, and while it tries to maintain immutable datastructures, it fails in a number of places. sorry about that.

### Thanks
