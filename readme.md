# (inc clojure-brush)

## ;; Work In Progress

This project aims to product a smarter clojure brush for [Syntax Highlighter](https://github.com/alexgorbatchev/SyntaxHighlighter) that goes further than existing efforts such as [sh-clojure](https://github.com/sattvik/sh-clojure) .

The current state of this project is a stream of consciousness javascript file. You'll need to know how to set up SyntaxHighlighter if you want to play with it (i'll get a demo setup later). 

**Not Ready For Real Use!** 

No error handling exists yet. Bugs abound.


### Thanks
